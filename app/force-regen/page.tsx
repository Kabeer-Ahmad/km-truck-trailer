      faqItems={[{"question":"What is a force regen?","answer":"A forced regeneration is a process where your truck's DPF (diesel particulate filter) is cleaned by burning off accumulated soot using elevated exhaust temperatures, initiated via diagnostic software."},{"question":"How long does force regen take?","answer":"A typical forced regeneration takes 45–90 minutes to complete, depending on the engine and DPF condition."},{"question":"Do you come to my location?","answer":"Yes! Our mobile team comes to your truck's location - roadside, truck stop, or your yard - anywhere in South Carolina."},{"question":"When do I need a force regen vs DPF cleaning?","answer":"Force regen clears soot through heat. If soot levels are very high or there's ash buildup, physical DPF cleaning may also be needed."}]}
